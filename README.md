# The Pathfinder by Zahracolt #


A fun side scrolling game based on my fave cryptocurrency, the Algorand. The game respesents the bulls and bears in the price of Algorand on the crypto market. The goal of the game is to gather as many points as possible without completely falling off of the path. You can walk by the edges as you please, but if you go completely off the path, you will lose a life and your avatar will reset. You will have three lives to do this after which, the game will be over and you'll recieve your final score. The game is scored by adding points for each rail, increasing point values with speed. How far can you go?!

This game was developed in Python using the PyGame module as a way to test out game logic development and quite frankly, have a bit of fun. To see a demonstration of the gameplay, check out my [YouTube Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/2ZlysvuEmRo "YouTube Video Demo Link").

## Control Keys ##

The gameplay is very simple. To get started, use the up, down, left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to control your avatar. When you fall off the rails, the avatar will reset and you'll be instructed to press any arrow key to continue. Once you've run out of lives you'll reach the game over screen. Press the space key to reset the game and play again!


### How to Play: Download and Run in Python Interpreter ###

Ideally, you will be playing this on a desktop computer. In your terminal window, you should be able to clone this repository using the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/zahracolt/the-pathfinder.git`

You'll need to have the PyGame module installed to play this, so if you don't already have it installed, use the following command to install it.

`pip install pygame`

Once you've cloned the repository and pip installed pygame, you should be able to play the game by changing the current directory to the repository directory and running the main file.

`cd the-pathfinder`

`python3 dfotr_game_main.py`

We look forward to work on version 2
